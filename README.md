# Workshop: Hands-on Infrastructure-as-Code with OpenTofu (Terraform)

This repository contains code for a workshop on the basics of both [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org) (Terraform) and [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io). The accompanying slides are published on my website: [https://patrick-moelk.eu/en/events/](https://patrick-moelk.eu/en/events/)


## AWS and Localstack

The workshop is most effective with a real AWS account. However, most exercises can be completed by targeting a local dockerized emulation of AWS using [localstack](https://www.localstack.cloud).
