# Workshop: Hands-on Infrastructure-as-Code with OpenTofu (Terraform)

This repository contains code for a workshop on the basics of both [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org) (Terraform) and [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io). The accompanying slides will be published on my website.


## AWS and Localstack

The workshop is most effective with a real AWS account. However, most exercises can be completed by targeting a local dockerized emulation of AWS using [localstack](https://www.localstack.cloud).


## Attribution

Chapter 4 of the workshop is largely inspired by the [Quick Start](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/) and [Overview](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/overview/) tutorials by Gruntwork, licensed under the MIT License as of [January 18, 2026](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/5c55a5a1604050f7f72b5100544721bceea426f1/LICENSE.txt).
